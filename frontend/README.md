# AutoBlog Frontend

A simple frontend application built to display AI-generated blog articles, consuming the AutoBlog Backend API.

This project is built with:

-   **React**
-   **Vite**
-   **TypeScript** (if applicable)
-   **Tailwind CSS**
-   **Axios**
-   **React Router**

The main goal of this frontend is to provide a clean and minimal interface to:

-   Fetch and list all generated articles
-   Navigate to a detailed page for each article
-   Render content generated by the AI in a readable and responsive layout

## Installation

Install my project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SirRuanMatos/auto-blog.git
    cd auto-blog
    cd frontend
    npm install
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`VITE_API_URL` - Base URL of the AutoBlog Backend API.

```bash
VITE_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000/autoblog/v1"
```

## Start the Application (Development)

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

-   Start the server with hot reload
-   Watch your files for changes
    `Ensure your database is running before starting the application.`

## Start the Application (Production)

To build and run the application in production mode, use:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

What these commands do:

-   npm run build → compiles and optimizes the project for production
-   npm run start → runs the compiled application
    `In production mode, npm does not reload automatically — it's optimized for performance and stability.`
